module: nasa_neow

short_description: Interact with NASA NEOW. More information available at https://api.nasa.gov.

version_added: "2.9"

description:
    - "This module gets data from NASA NEOW service and converts this data to YAML format, saving it on the local system. The outputted file is saved in the format neow-YYYY-MM-DDtoYYY-MM-DD.yml. By default the file is saved to the local folder, however, the user can control the path as to where the output file is placed. This module will only show CHANGED if the module creates a YAML output file. If the module FAILS it will display the HTTP code associated with the failed response."
